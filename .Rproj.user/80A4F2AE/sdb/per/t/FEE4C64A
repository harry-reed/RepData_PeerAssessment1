Also, the new imputed median becomes identical to the mean.\n\nBased on the distribution histograms, Imputing mean values to account for missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps yields higher frquency counts in the center of the histogram (close to its mean).\n\n\n## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?\n\nCreate a new factor with two levele 'weekday' and 'weekend' where 'weekday' implies Monday thru Friday and 'weekend' implies Saturday thru Sunday.\n\n```{r}\n\nactData_Imputed <- transform(actData_Imputed, timeframe=factor(ifelse((weekdays(date) %in% c(\"Saturday\", \"Sunday\")), \"weekend\", \"weekday\")))\n\nhead(actData_Imputed)\n\n```\n\nNext we make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = “l”) of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).\n\n```{r}\n\nintByWeek <- aggregate(steps ~ timeframe+interval, data=actData_Imputed, FUN=mean)\n\nlibrary(lattice)\nxyplot(steps ~ interval | timeframe,\n       layout = c(1, 2),\n       xlab=\"5 Minute Interval\",\n       ylab=\"Avg Number of Steps Taken\",\n       main=\"Avg Num Steps Taken per 5-Min Int Across Weekdays & Weekends\",\n       type=\"l\",\n       lty=1,\n       horizontal=FALSE,\n       data=intByWeek)\n\n```\n\nIt seems that the weekday activities start sooner than those on the weekends; however, weekend activities have higher exertions a few hours before noon until evening (around 9 pm).  Through the night until early morning (9 pm to 5 am), both activity levels seem to be similar.\n\n",
